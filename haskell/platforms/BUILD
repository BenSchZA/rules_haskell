# This file declares constraint values for each platform supported by
# GHC. These rules follow the GHC naming convention, for example,
# //haskell/platform:linux and //haskell/platform:x86_64. See the
# config.guess in any GHC source distribution for possible platforms.
#
# These can be used in select expressions to choose platform-specifc
# sources and dependencies.
