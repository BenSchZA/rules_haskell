## [0.4] - 2018-02-27

### Added

* `hidden_modules` attribute of the `haskell_library` rule. This allows to
  selectively hide modules in a library. See
  [#152](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/issues/152).

### Fixed

* Test executables now find shared libraries correctly at runtime. See
  [#151](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/issues/151).

* Building of certain modules does not fail with the “file name does not
  match module name” message anymore. See
  [#139](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/issues/139).

* Linking issues that resulted in unresolved symbols due to incorrect order
  in which static libraries are passed to linker are not resolved. See
  [#140](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/issues/140).

* The “grep not found” error is fixed. See
  [#141](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/pull/141).

* System-level shared libraries introduced by `haskell_cc_import` are now
  found correctly during compilation. See
  [#142](https://github.com/tweag/rules_haskell/issues/142).
